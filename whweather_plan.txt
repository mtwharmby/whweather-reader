whweather - Wharmby's Weather Station

Requirement: read temperature & humidity from serial (USB) or network device and write this to a sink.
Later: air-pressure, anemometer, rain gauge

Should be able to:
- accept data from:
-- serial connected device
-- directly connected device (gpio)
-- network connected device (socket)
- structure received data
- write structured data to:
-- file
-- database

Data will arrive in a reasonable format:
time=xyz::temp=xyz::humid=xyz
- time quoted in ms since start time of device (for arduinos)

Program flow pseudo code:
while loop:
for each registered listener:
call non-blocking listen
if message
transform message into structured data
call writers with data
sleep defined time

methods to:
- transform data from above format to dictionary
- register listeners
- register writers

attributes:
- devices (name:start_time) *if arduino, need to know when overflow will occur
- listeners
- writers

Listeners need:
- read_data method (returns the data in the format above, without newlines etc.)
- get_init_data method (init data is to associate name and dev start time)
- set_data_send_freq (sets with what frequency the external source sends readings)

Writers need:
- write_data method (puts data into whatever sink the writer is designed to)

----

Listeners:
- need a name/id and a relative time reading for each device

Serial:
- need to specify config (e.g. which serial port to listen on)

Network:
- can we have simultaneous connections to same port? How is this handled
- need to get name/id of device sending data

----

Writers:
- file
- sqlite database
- influxdb
