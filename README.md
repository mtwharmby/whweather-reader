Wharmby's Weather station Reader - a first arduino project

Python project to read data from various sensors attached to either an arduino or Raspberry Pi (GPIO). Intention is to run this as a daemon on a Raspberry Pi and have it read arduinos connected via the USB/serial interface or connecting via a socket over the network (WiFi).
